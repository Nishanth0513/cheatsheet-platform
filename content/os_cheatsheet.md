## Process Management
- Process: An instance of a program in execution.
- PCB (Process Control Block): Stores process state, program counter, CPU registers, etc.
- Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin.

## Memory Management
- Paging: Fixed-size blocks.
- Segmentation: Variable-size segments.
- Virtual Memory: Demand paging, page replacement algorithms (LRU, FIFO, Optimal).

## Deadlocks
- Conditions: Mutual exclusion, Hold & wait, No preemption, Circular wait.
- Prevention: Break one of the above conditions.
- Detection & Recovery.

## File Systems
- Directory structures: Single-level, Two-level, Tree-structured.
- Allocation methods: Contiguous, Linked, Indexed.
