## OSI Model Layers
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## OSI Model Layers
1. Physical Layer
Function: Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium.
Applications/Examples:

Ethernet cables (Cat5, Cat6)

Fiber optics

Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)

Hubs, repeaters

2. Data Link Layer
Function: Ensures reliable node-to-node data transfer, handles MAC addresses and error detection.
Applications/Examples:

Ethernet (MAC addressing)

Switches

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)

3. Network Layer
Function: Routes data packets between devices/networks using logical addressing (IP).
Applications/Examples:

IP (IPv4, IPv6)

Routers

ICMP (ping, traceroute)

OSPF, BGP routing protocols

4. Transport Layer
Function: Provides reliable or unreliable delivery and manages data segmentation.
Applications/Examples:

TCP (reliable)

UDP (faster, no guarantee)

Port numbers (HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443)

5. Session Layer
Function: Manages and controls dialog between two devices; establishes, maintains, and ends sessions.
Applications/Examples:

NetBIOS

RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)

6. Presentation Layer
Function: Translates data between application and network formats (encryption, compression, encoding).
Applications/Examples:

SSL/TLS encryption

JPEG, PNG, GIF formats

ASCII, Unicode text encoding

7. Application Layer
Function: Interfaces directly with user applications and services.
Applications/Examples:

HTTP/HTTPS

FTP

SMTP (email)

DNS
## Protocols
- HTTP/HTTPS
- TCP/UDP
- IP addressing: IPv4, IPv6

## Networking Devices
- Router, Switch, Hub, Gateway.

## Common Ports
- HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443, FTP: 21, SSH: 22.
